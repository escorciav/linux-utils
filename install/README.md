# Install

Anatomy of packages, compilers, libs, apps that I use.

I would like to use conda all the time but it's not possible yet.
Therefor, it's an attempt to keep everything organized and a bit more reproducible.
It's not automated yet. Once, I read that you do it first, twice (in less time) and the third time you automate it :wink:

## Organization

The root contains two folders:

1. [source](source/README.md)

Allocate source code, executables packing code & binaries, etc.

2. [bin](bin/README.md)

Allocate binaries after compiling the source code
