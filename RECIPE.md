# Setting up everything

1. Interacting with servers

Do it for developing mode interacting with github, gitlab, etc.

- Follow this [help](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/).
- If security is a concern, read [this](https://developer.github.com/guides/using-ssh-agent-forwarding/) instead of using/launching ssh-agent. 

2. Setup dotfiles.

F**k your company, office, desktop, whatever; shell is your real workspace.

- Clone [dotfiles](https://github.com/escorciav/linux-utils).
- Edit according to the demand of your task on that machine.

3. Program (ToDo)

- [ssh](##ssh)
- [python](##)

## SSH

1. Customize your `.ssh/config`. There is an example in the repo.
